Who doesn't use git! But most of us using git without knowing some special command like `git reset`

In this blog, I will discuss some use cases of `git reset` command.

## Undo a commit
After commiting something changes you find out you don't need the commit yet. So you want the commit in `unstaged` mode.
Let's do it in git commad. Git `reset` command help you to do this.

```bash
# copy sha1-commit-id for the commit you want to undo
git log
# reset the commit to prevous commit
git reset --soft <sha1-commit-id>
# it will move your commit to staged mode.
git restore --staged commit_file

```

## Delete a commit
If you want to delete a commit you can use `--hard` argument to do this. Although this is dangerous but while doing this you need to be careful.

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "this commit will get deleted with all info"
# copy previous commit sha1-hash-id
git reset --hard sha1-hash-id
# or you can move the head to previous commit by
git reset --hard HEAD~1
# the recent commit will get delete and previous commit will the HEAD
```
