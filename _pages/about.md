---

I am a deep learning engineer with more than 3-year experience in building, training, and evaluating data-dependent deep learning models. My strongest skills are natural language processing(NLP) and deep learning. Previously I work with companies in the AI domain and closely gather knowledge about how machine learning models can build and integrate with an enterprise.
I have built some open source projects based on NLP and my project is being widely used by the NLP community.

My research/working interest is in natural language processing and deep learning.

My main motive behind this blog is to keep track of my learning and share my knowledge and experience with the NLP community.
