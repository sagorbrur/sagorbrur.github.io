# Basic Overview of Automatic Text Summarization

#Text Summarization: 
Text summarization is the process of shortening a text document, in order to create a summary of the major points of the original document.

# Automatic Text Summarization:
Automatic summarization is the process of shortening a text document with software, in order to create a summary with the major points of the original document. Technologies that can make a coherent summary take into account variables such as length, writing style and syntax. 

# There are two general approaches to automatic summarization: 
1. Extraction: 
Extractive methods work by selecting a subset of existing words, phrases, or sentences in the original text to form the summary. 

2. Abstraction:
Abstractive methods build an internal semantic representation and then use natural language generation techniques to create a summary that is closer to what a human might express. 

Reason for Automatic Text Summarization: 
Summaries reduce reading time.
When researching documents, summaries make the selection process easier.
Automatic summarization improves the effectiveness of indexing. 
Automatic summarization algorithms are less biased than human summarizers. 
Personalized summaries are useful in question-answering systems as they provide personalized information. 
Using automatic or semi-automatic summarization systems enables commercial abstract services to increase the number of texts they are able to process.
